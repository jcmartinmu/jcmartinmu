### Hi there!

Thank you for stopping by, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

Iâ€™m currently working on two research projects:
  - Machine Learning methods applied to urban mobility.
  - Spatio temporal modeling of Drinking Water violations.
  
However, I like to learn about everything! ðŸŒ±

Also, I am an advocate of human and animal rights. I strongly believe that health care should be a universal right and not a privilege. I hope AI can help to make this dream a reality.

If you have comments or if there is something I can do to help you please email me to juan.c.martinez@vanderbilt.edu  ðŸ“«
