### Hi there!

Thank you for stopping by, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I have a great interest in Spatio-temporal modeling and data visualization, and I have some experience in the following areas:
  - Machine Learning methods applied to urban mobility and raster/image classification.
  - Spatio-temporal modeling of Drinking Water violations.
However, I like to learn about everything! ðŸŒ±

Also, I am an advocate of human and animal rights.

I strongly believe that health care should be a universal right and not a privilege. I hope AI can help to make this dream a reality.

If you have comments or if there is something I can do to help you please email me at jcmartinez.igeologo@gmail.com  ðŸ“«
